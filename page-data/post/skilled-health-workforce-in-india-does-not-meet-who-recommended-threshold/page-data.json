In eastern and rural states total health workforce density was lower than the WHO minimum threshold of 22.8 per 10,000 population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">According to the registry data the density of doctors and nurses and midwives per 10,000 population across India was 26.7, whereas the NSS0 data put it at 20.6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">The estimates also reveal “an alarmingly large presence of unqualified health professionals,” as adjusting for adequate qualifications of health workers reduced the workforce density from 29 to 16 health workers per 10,000 population.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">The presence of unqualified health professionals in the health system is not unique in India. Unqualified health professionals are usually the first point of contact for rural and poor population in many low-income and middle-income countries.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">The data also showed that approximately 25% of currently working health professionals do not have the required qualifications as laid down by professional councils, and that 20% of adequately qualified doctors are not in the current workforce. More than 80% of doctors and 70% of nurses and midwives were employed in the private sector.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">The researchers point to several limitations of their study, including the registration data being inadequately updated and likely to include deceased, unemployed and professionals who have migrated overseas, and the survey data being self- and also outdated reported.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">Nevertheless the authors were able to conclude: “Distribution and qualification of health professionals are serious problems in India when compared with the overall size of the health workers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif\">“Policy should focus on enhancing the quality of health workers and mainstreaming professionally qualified persons into the health workforce.”</span><!--TrendMD v2.4.6--></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"BMJ PWA demo"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"a24308a0-396e-5d71-81b6-28d632b69c90"}}}
