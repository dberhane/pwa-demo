However, September has also welcomed two new entries into the top ten.</p>\n<p>New in at number six is a study protocol for a scoping review by Kaasbøll <span class=\"name\">and </span><span class=\"name\">Paulsen</span>. The scoping review aims to investigate LGBTQ perspectives in a child welfare context and aims to identify gaps in the literature to help future research. To conduct this review, the authors plan to utilise the scoping review framework outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI), which is based on previous work by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac and colleagues. This work will contribute to a multistep research project on LGBTQ issues within a child welfare context and help guide the development of future questionnaires, interview guides and research questions. In addition, the authors hope to expand on the current knowledge of LGBTQ perspectives in child welfare and inform policy makers.</p>\n<p>Entering the list at number ten is a retrospective observational study by Kazis et al. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between the type of initial healthcare provider and early and long-term opioid use for lower back pain. The sample consisted of patients that visited a healthcare provider in the USA for help with the management of new onset lower back pain. Their results showed that the incidence of short-term opioid use among the sample was 22%. The authors then go onto conclude that initial visitations to a physical therapist or chiropractor were associated with decreased early and long-term opioid use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 1273px\" width=\"639\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\"> <strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"132\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"422\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">1</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Stiglic and Viner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">2</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Kapoor et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/8/e026850\">Missing female patients: an observational analysis of sex ratio among outpatients in a referral tertiary care public hospital in India</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">3</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\"><span class=\"name\">Watai et al.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e023450\">Effects of short-term smoking on lung function and airway hyper-responsiveness in young patients with untreated intermittent adult-onset asthma: retrospective cross-sectional study at a primary–tertiary care hospital in Japan</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">4</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\"><span class=\"name\">Dennermalm et al.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024459\">“You can smell the freedom”: a qualitative study on perceptions and experiences of sex among Swedish men who have sex with men in Berlin</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">5</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\"><span class=\"name\">Du Mont et al.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\">\n<div class=\"highwire-cite-title\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e023880\">Assessment of nurses’ competence to care for sexually assaulted trans persons: a survey of Ontario’s Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centres</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">6</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\"><span class=\"name\">Kaasbøll and </span><span class=\"name\">Paulsen.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030675\">What is known about the LGBTQ perspective in child welfare services?
