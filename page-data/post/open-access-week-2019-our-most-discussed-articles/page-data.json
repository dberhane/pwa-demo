In this study the authors evaluated the risk of bias and certainty of evidence of the studies selected by Cipriani et al. Munkholm et al concluded that Cipriani’s conclusions on the benefits of antidepressants for depression in adults were not supported. The results of this study gained the attention of a few news outlets and was a popular topic of discussion among Twitter users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2019/10/9-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-1439 alignleft\" title=\"Data from Altmetric.com\" src=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjopen/files/2019/10/9-1.png\" alt=\"Altmetric.com graph\" width=\"102\" height=\"90\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>9 &#8211; Compliance with ethical standards in the reporting of donor sources and ethics review in peer-reviewed publications involving organ transplantation in </strong><strong style=\"font-size: 1rem\">China: a scoping review</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024473\">Rogers et al</a>’s scoping review on published articles that involved organ transplantation was the centre of many discussions regarding peer-review and ethics in scientific and medical publishing. The scoping review investigated whether research papers that involved organ transplantation in China followed international professional standards that aim to exclude unethical research practices. Such practices included research conducted without IRB approval or consent from donors and the use of biological material from executed prisoners. Rogers et al found that 92.5% of the studies included in their analysis did not report whether organs were sourced from executed prisoners, and that another 99% failed to disclose whether consent from the donors was obtained. The findings of this article quickly caught the attention of several news outlets and scientific journals and prompted numerous investigations into the published articles.

Seferidi et al conducted a modelling study to determine how different Brexit trade policy scenarios will impact the price, intake of fruit and vegetables and consequential cardiovascular disease related deaths between 2021 and 2030. The authors modelled four post Brexit trade scenarios which included the event of a no-deal Brexit and measured the cumulative stroke and coronary heart disease deaths that were attributed to each scenario. Each scenario was modelled between 2021 and 2030. In their conclusions, the authors advised that that UK government should consider the public health implications and changes to food systems when considering Brexit trade policy options.
