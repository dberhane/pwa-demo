New to the list this month is a cohort study of routine induction in late-term pregnancies from Denmark. The country introduced a new policy in 2011 aiming to prevent stillbirths and other foetal and maternal complications in post-term pregnancies. Rydahl and colleagues examined the maternal and neonatal consequences of the policy by comparing the preintervention period (2000–2010) with the postintervention period (2012–2016), finding no differences in neonatal outcomes including stillbirth.</p>\n<p>Also new at number 7 is a randomised trial evaluating the prevalence and psychosocial correlates of clinically significant depressive symptoms in 544 HIV-negative gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) in England. The participants were taken from a randomised trial evaluating the benefit of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was high, ranging from 9.1% at baseline to 14.4% at months 12 and 24. Measures of intimate partner violence, internalised homophobia and concealment of sexual identity were strongly associated with depression.</p>\n<p>Our last new entry is at number 8: a cohort study and meta-analysis from the Mayo Clinic in the United States examining the association between hyperlipidemia and mortality after incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The cohort study found that concurrent hyperlipidemia, compared with no hyperlipidemia, was associated with a lower mortality and attenuation of mortality associations with other competing comorbidities. These findings were also supported by the meta-analysis.</p>\n<p>Remaining very popular this month is Stiglic and Viner’s systematic review of screentime and children and young people’s health and well-being, which moves back up to first position.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"height: 975px\" width=\"717\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">1</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Stiglic and Viner</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">2</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Ali et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e029364\">Sex-specific prevalence, inequality and associated predictors of hypertension, diabetes, and comorbidity among Bangladeshi adults: results from a nationwide cross-sectional demographic and health survey</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">3</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Kapoor et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/8/e026850\">Missing female patients: an observational analysis of sex ratio among outpatients in a referral tertiary care public hospital in India</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">4</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Williams et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/11/e031541\">Examining risk factors for self-harm and suicide in LGBTQ+ young people: a systematic review protocol</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">5</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Rydahl et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/12/e032815\">Routine induction in late-term pregnancies: follow-up of a Danish induction of labour paradigm</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">6</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Kaasbøll and Paulsen</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030675\">What is known about the LGBTQ perspective in child welfare services?
