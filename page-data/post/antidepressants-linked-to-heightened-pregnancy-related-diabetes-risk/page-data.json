These pregnancies are prone to complications, such as overweight babies and prolonged labour due to the baby getting stuck in the birth canal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The children of these pregnancies may also be more vulnerable to obesity and diabetes later on, while the mums are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Previous research looking at the potential link between antidepressant use and gestational diabetes risk has proved inconclusive and has been hampered by study design, say the researchers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They drew on information from the Quebec Pregnancy Cohort, which incorporates three Canadian databases, and includes all pregnancies and children born in Quebec between 1998 and 2015.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each case of gestational diabetes (20,905), identified after 20 weeks of pregnancy, was randomly matched with 10 unaffected pregnancies (209,050) of the same age and calendar year of delivery.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Antidepressant use was assessed using information on prescriptions filled for these drugs between the start of pregnancy and the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. In all, 9741 (just over 4%) of the mums took antidepressants, singly or combined.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These included citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline, which belong to a class of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs for short; venlafaxine; and amitriptyline.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After taking account of potentially influential factors, such as the mum’s age, welfare assistance, area of residence and other underlying conditions, taking antidepressants during pregnancy was associated with a heightened risk of developing gestational diabetes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taking any of these drugs was associated with a 19% heightened risk of being diagnosed with the condition compared with not taking antidepressants during pregnancy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The risk was greatest for two antidepressant drugs, in particular: venlafaxine (27% heightened risk); and amitriptyline (52% heightened risk).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What’s more, the risk increased, the longer certain types of antidepressants were taken, specifically SNRIs and tricyclics, singly or when combined.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Short term use was associated with a 15% heightened risk; medium term use was associated with a 17% heightened risk; and long term use with a 29% heightened risk.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When further analysis was done on a smaller group of women (21,395) who had been diagnosed with depression/anxiety before they became pregnant, the results were similar to those of the main analysis.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause. But there are some possible explanations for what they found, say the researchers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This  includes that antidepressants directly affect glucose metabolism, especially as serotonin is involved in this process. And one of the side effects of antidepressants is weight gain, a risk factor for diabetes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the pros and cons of taking antidepressants during pregnancy need to be weighed up carefully, caution the researchers, particularly for women whose depression is severe.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The treatment of depression is a major concern and is challenging because depression is prevalent before and during pregnancy, and untreated depression can lead to relapse during pregnancy and in the [period immediately after birth],” they write.</p>\n<p><!--TrendMD v2.4.7--></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"BMJ PWA demo"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9d02bd42-0dca-5bb1-a39f-b06bbc67a142"}}}
