The article presents evidence for associations between screentime and a variety of health harms for this population, including adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Also maintaining a position in the top five is a study by Woolf et al. examining the effect of sex on the specialty recruitment outcomes of UK medical graduates, providing evidence for sex differences in applications to specialty training.</p>\n<p>The top ten list for May sees two new entries. In at number six is a new study by Kuh et al. investigating whether developmental factors are associated with grip strength in adults aged between 53 and 69 years. Several developmental factors, such as increased birth weight, earlier age at first standing, and beginning to walk ‘on time’ were associated with increased grip strength. The results also indicated that the speed of decline in grip strength was associated with cognitive ability. The authors conclude that interventions that promote muscle development or maintain muscle strength could increase the chance of an independent old age.</p>\n<p>In at number eight is a study by Medisauskaite and Kamau that assessed the prevalence of alcohol use, binge-eating, and health problems among UK doctors, and investigated whether occupational distress increases the risk of health problems. A substantial proportion of the cohort recorded binge drinking (44% of doctors binge-drank and 5% met the criteria for alcohol dependence), as well as sleep problems (20–61% of doctors). Additionally, occupational distress and job factors increased the odds of doctors using substances, having sleep problems, presenting with frequent symptoms of ill health, and binge-eating. The study provides important evidence for the possible impact of occupational distress on doctors’ health in the UK.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 945px\" width=\"743\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">1</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Stiglic and Viner</td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">2</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Müller <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/8/e022202\">Impact of the communication and patient hand-off tool SBAR on patient safety: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">3</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Woolf <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e025004\">Effect of sex on specialty training application outcomes: a longitudinal administrative data study of UK medical graduates</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">4</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Harling<em> et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e023272\">HIV risk and pre-exposure prophylaxis interest among female bar workers in Dar es Salaam: cross-sectional survey</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">5</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Ramnanansingh and Nayak</td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/2/e024029\">Application of a novel sex independent anthropometric index, termed angle index, in relation to type 2 diabetes: a Trinidadian case-control study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">6</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Kuh <em>et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e025755\">Developmental factors associated with decline in grip strength from midlife to old age: a British birth cohort study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">7</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Li<em> et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e024079\">Childhood maltreatment and biomarkers for cardiometabolic disease in mid-adulthood in a prospective British birth cohort: associations and potential explanations</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">8</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Medisauskaite and Kamau</td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e027362\">Does occupational distress raise the risk of alcohol use, binge-eating, ill health and sleep problems among medical doctors?
