For girls, this peak occurred at the age of 15, compared with 16 for boys. But rates fell by at least half by the age of 17 for both sexes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Comparable figures for 8-12 year olds were 3.2/100,000, overall, with rates of 4/100,000 for 11 year olds, and 12/100,000  for 12 year olds, the calculations indicated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Future research should explore the development of earlier interventions, given evidence of an increase in incidence in young children, suggesting that onset of anorexia nervosa may be starting earlier for some young people than suggested by previous research,” write the researchers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause. And missing data, including cases where young people were seen only by a GP, or didn’t come to the attention of services, may have affected the accuracy of the calculations.</p>\n<p>But this is a large, nationally representative study, based on confirmed diagnoses, and its findings may therefore also be applicable to other high-income countries, suggest the researchers.</p>\n<p>While firm conclusions about changes in the rate of new cases over time can’t be drawn due to the lack of existing secondary care data, and differences in the way data have been collected, “service providers and commissioners should consider the evidence to suggest an increase in the number of new cases in younger children,” they add.</p>\n<p><!--TrendMD v2.4.7--></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"BMJ PWA demo"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"759c7953-8aa7-51e1-b7b0-e64511fecdb7"}}}
