This includes first position, a study by researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Denmark that reanalyses data from a systematic review and network meta-analysis on antidepressants for depression. Taking into account several biases, their reanalysis suggests that the evidence does not support definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of antidepressants for depression in adults, including whether they are more efficacious than placebo for depression.</p>\n<p>Also new at number 7 is a cross-sectional survey of productivity loss due to menstruation-related symptoms in more than 30,000 women from the Netherlands. The study&#8217;s results indicate that menstrual period symptoms may be linked to nearly nine days of lost productivity every year through presenteeism. Our last new entry is a meta-analysis by Wang and colleagues investigating sex differences in the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on major cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality. Their meta-analysis suggests that women with DM have a much higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiac death and all-cause mortality compared to men with DM.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 1185px\" width=\"508\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">1</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Munkholm et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024886\">Considering the methodological limitations in the evidence base of antidepressants for depression: a reanalysis of a network meta-analysis</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">2</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Müller et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/8/e022202\">Impact of the communication and patient hand-off tool SBAR on patient safety: a systematic review</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">3</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Watai et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e023450.long\">Effects of short-term smoking on lung function and airway hyper-responsiveness in young patients with untreated intermittent adult-onset asthma: retrospective cross-sectional study at a primary-tertiary care hospital in Japan</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">4</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Du Mont et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e023880\">Assessment of nurses competence to care for sexually assaulted trans persons: a survey of Ontarios Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centres</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">5</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Dennermalm et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024459\">&#8220;You can smell the freedom&#8221;: a qualitative study on perceptions and experiences of sex among Swedish men who have sex with men in Berlin</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">6</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Kuh et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e025755\">Developmental factors associated with decline in grip strength from midlife to old age: a British birth cohort study</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">7</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Schoep et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e026186\">Productivity loss due to menstruation-related symptoms: a nationwide cross-sectional survey among 32 748 women</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">8</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Stiglic et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">9</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Wang et al. </em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e024935\">Association between diabetes mellitus and the risk for major cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in women compared with men: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">10</td>\n<td width=\"170\"><em>Woolf et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/3/e025004\">Effect of sex on specialty training application outcomes: a longitudinal administrative data study of UK medical graduates</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>Most read figures are based on pdf downloads and full text views.
