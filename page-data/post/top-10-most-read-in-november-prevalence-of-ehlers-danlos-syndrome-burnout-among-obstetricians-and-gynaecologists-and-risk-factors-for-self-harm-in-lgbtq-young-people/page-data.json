At number one is a cohort and nested case-control study describing the epidemiology of diagnosed hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD) and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) using linked electronic medical records. EDS and HSD have historically been considered rare diseases only affecting the musculoskeletal system and soft tissues, but these authors demonstrate that both these assertions should be reconsidered. As a result, this article has attracted a lot of attention on social media since its publication, with an <a href=\"https://bmj.altmetric.com/details/69779396\">Altmetric score of 405</a>.</p>\n<p>At numbers six and seven are two papers looking at care for the LGBTQ+ community. Returning this month is Kaasbøll <em>et al</em> with a scoping review protocol aiming to look at the existing research on LGBTQ issues in the context of child welfare services. Entering the list for the first time at number seven is a systematic review protocol presenting the plans for a systematic review of risk factors associated with self-harm, suicidal ideation and behaviour in LGBTQ+ young people.</p>\n<p>Also new to the list this month is a cross-sectional survey study looking at burnout in doctors practising obstetrics and gynaecology. The authors received over 3,000 responses to their survey and found high levels of burnout, particularly among trainees. Burnout was associated with both increased defensive medical practice and worse doctor wellbeing. They go on to state that these findings could have implications for the well-being and retention of doctors as well as the quality of patient care.</p>\n<p>Remaining popular, and staying in the top list for November, is the study by Stiglic and Viner examining the effects of screentime on the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. Picked up by a number of news outlets, and again popular on social media, this study showed that there is evidence that higher levels of screentime are associated with a variety of health harms for children and young people, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Finally, at number ten, we have a time trend analysis by Taylor-Robinson et al investigating inequalities in the sustained rise in infant mortality in England and the contribution of rising child poverty to these trends.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 946px\" width=\"744\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\"><strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">1</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Demmler<em> et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/11/e031365\">Diagnosed prevalence of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder in Wales, UK: a national electronic cohort study and case-control comparison</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">2</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Stiglic<em> et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"45\">3</td>\n<td width=\"170\">Wilkinson<em> et al.</em></td>\n<td width=\"401\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/10/e028763\">Costs of switching to low global warming potential inhalers.
