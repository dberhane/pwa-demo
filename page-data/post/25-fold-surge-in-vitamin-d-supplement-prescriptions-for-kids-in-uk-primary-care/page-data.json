And several studies have linked low levels of the vitamin with various conditions, including diabetes, asthma, and eczema.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yet most clinical trials have failed to show any meaningful impact of supplementation on improving health.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While severe vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets and seizures in children, it’s not clear what impact vitamin D insufficiency has.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To get a handle on prescribing patterns of vitamin D supplements in primary care over time, the researchers drew on information from medical records submitted by GPs to the Health Improvement Network (THIN) between 2008 and 2016 inclusive.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The THIN database contains anonymised data from 744 general practices and around 16 million patients, equivalent to more than 6% of the UK population.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the study period, 12, 277 children from 723 general practices were prescribed vitamin D supplements for the first time. Girls were more likely than boys to be prescribed these supplements, and prescribing rates were higher in England than elsewhere in the UK.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Older age, social deprivation, and black, Afro-Caribbean and Asian ethnicities were all associated with higher rates of vitamin D prescribing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By 2016, the prescribing rate was more than 25 times higher than it had been in 2008, rising from 10.8 to 276.8/100,000 person years.* This trend was particularly noticeable among 12-17 year olds, among whom girls were nearly twice as likely to be prescribed a vitamin D supplement as boys.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But increased prescribing rates occurred across all the other age groups: 0-6 months; 6 months-4 years; 4-11 years.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, between 29% and 56% of prescriptions annually had no linked blood test results for vitamin D levels recorded in the 3 months before the prescription was issued.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Less than a third (29.5%) of all children prescribed the supplement had symptoms indicative of vitamin D deficiency, including aches and pains, tiredness or fatigue. Among those with no vitamin D levels recorded beforehand, symptoms were recorded for just one in six.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prescribed doses varied greatly, with a tendency to increasingly prescribe therapeutic (pharmacological) doses to children, irrespective of their vitamin D levels.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Official guidance recommends prescribing therapeutic doses of supplementary vitamin D only to those actually diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, note the researchers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“There has been a marked and sustained increase in vitamin D prescribing in children in UK primary care,” write the researchers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While this may reflect the success of the Department of Health and Social Care’s efforts in raising awareness of vitamin D deficiency, findings from our study would suggest that nationally set recommendations on vitamin D supplementation are not consistently followed by GPs, in terms of the number of patients treated, the doses used for supplementation, as well as the practice of prescribing vitamin D without appropriate testing,” they conclude.</p>\n<p><!--TrendMD v2.4.7--></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"BMJ PWA demo"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"324da998-7264-51e2-91b8-5e7bf409f455"}}}
