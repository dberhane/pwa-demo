We also see four new entries. New in at number one is a study by Kapoor et al. investigating gender discrimination in terms of access to healthcare in India. Outpatient data from a large referral hospital were used to compare visits from male and female patients (excluding patients visiting obstetrics and gynaecology departments), with analysis showing that female patients made fewer visits than male patients. This effect was found to be worse for female patients who were in the younger and older age groups, and for those who lived at increasing distances from the hospital.</p>\n<p>New in at number eight is a study by Herrmann-Werner et al. that asked the question of whether obesity simulation suits are a useful tool for the training of medical students. Several outcomes were measured, such as the practicality of using the suit during training sessions, how authentic it was, and how it affected participants’ attitudes to the individual wearing the suit. The results indicated that both student and teacher participants felt that the suit was a useful tool in the simulation of interactions with patients with type 2 diabetes, and the students reported that it helped them empathise with the patient. However, students also showed stronger anti-fat prejudices compared with the people representing the patient in the exercise and the teachers, suggesting that further training might be needed to reduce prejudice.</p>\n<p>Also new this month at number nine, Grummer-Strawn et al. present a review of the websites of professional paediatrics associations to assess the extent to which these associations are sponsored by companies that produce breast-milk substitutes. Sixty percent of 114 paediatric associations with a website or Facebook account had received financial support from these companies, with sponsorship (particularly of conferences) the most common type. The findings provide important insight into the potential involvement of companies that might have commercial interests.</p>\n<p>Finally, in at number ten is a paper in the recent <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/Suppl_3\">Child Health CheckPoint series</a>, which investigated childhood development in 1800 parent/child pairs with the aim of producing research that informs health policies. This paper presents metabolomic data from the participants, showing differences in the concentration of specific metabolites between childhood and adulthood, and in the metabolic profiles in children and adults by sex. It’s hoped that the data will be informative for the investigation of the childhood origins of adult non-communicable diseases, and for comparative studies in other populations.</p>\n<table style=\"height: 1294px\" width=\"741\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\"> <strong>Rank</strong></td>\n<td width=\"132\"><strong>Author(s)</strong></td>\n<td width=\"422\"><strong>Title</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">1</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Kapoor et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/8/e026850\">Missing female patients: an observational analysis of sex ratio among outpatients in a referral tertiary care public hospital in India</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">2</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Munkholm, Paludan-Müller, and Boesen</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024886\">Considering the methodological limitations in the evidence base of antidepressants for depression: a reanalysis of a network meta-analysis</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">3</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Watai et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e023450.long\">Effects of short-term smoking on lung function and airway hyper-responsiveness in young patients with untreated intermittent adult-onset asthma: retrospective cross-sectional study at a primary-tertiary care hospital in Japan</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">4</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Du Mont et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e023880\">Assessment of nurses competence to care for sexually assaulted trans persons: a survey of Ontarios Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centres</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">5</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Dennermalm et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/6/e024459\">&#8220;You can smell the freedom&#8221;: a qualitative study on perceptions and experiences of sex among Swedish men who have sex with men in Berlin</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">6</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Kuh et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e025755\">Developmental factors associated with decline in grip strength from midlife to old age: a British birth cohort study</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">7</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Stiglic and Viner</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/1/e023191\">Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"47\">8</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"132\">Herrmann-Werner et al.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"422\"><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/8/e029738\">Is an obesity simulation suit in an undergraduate medical communication class a valuable teaching tool?
